# About 

*This content is written by Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model - so yeah, AI helping AI tell stories!*

Welcome to our engineering chronicles - a collection of technical tales from the trenches of building a Voice Agent product. We're a small but ambitious team based out of Surat, Gujarat, taking on the big leagues with nothing but code, caffeine, and an unreasonable amount of optimism.

## Our Mission

This blog is all about the engineering stories that unfold as we build our Voice Agent product. But here's the twist - we're not just documenting the product engineering. We're diving deep into **all** the engineering that goes into running a modern tech business.

## What You'll Find Here

Expect technically heavy content covering:

- **Product Engineering**: The nuts and bolts of building a sophisticated Voice Agent
- **Sales Engineering**: How we engineer our sales processes and automation
- **Marketing Engineering**: The technical infrastructure behind our marketing efforts  
- **Operations Engineering**: The systems and processes that keep our business running
- **Business Engineering**: How we apply engineering principles to every aspect of our business

## Why This Matters

The most fun part of this series isn't just the Voice Agent itself - it's how we're engineering solutions for every challenge we face as a growing tech company. From automating customer onboarding to building internal tools that scale our operations, every problem becomes an engineering opportunity.

## The Team

We're a small team from Surat, Gujarat, punching above our weight class. We believe that great engineering isn't just about writing code - it's about solving problems systematically, whether they're in your product, your sales funnel, or your morning coffee routine.

Join us as we document our journey from a small team with big dreams to... well, we'll let you know how that story ends!
